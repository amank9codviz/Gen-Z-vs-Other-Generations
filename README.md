⏳ Screen Time
Millennials and Gen X have the highest average daily screen time (approaching 7 hours), while Boomers and Gen Z follow closely. However, Gen Z has a larger proportion of users in the "medium" usage category, indicating more balanced or purpose-driven engagement.


💬 Communication Preferences
Across all generations, text messaging dominates, with nearly 25% selecting it as their most common communication method. Voice calling and email lag behind, reinforcing the shift toward asynchronous communication.


📰 News Consumption
TV remains the most trusted news source across all groups, followed by newspapers and online news. Social media, despite its popularity, ranks lowest in trust a noteworthy insight for content marketers and digital strategists.
